- `cutecharts` is used to create ðŸ“‰ Hand drawing style charts library for Python
- Itâ€™s totally different from the regular `matplotlib` and `seaborn` library, it has a lookout of handmade charts and while hovering on the charts it shows us the values.
- The hovering effect is not there in the __matplotlib__ chart which is an advantage of cute charts.
- Creating charts in cute charts is a little bit longer compared to __seaborn__, but a still lesser number of codes than the standard __matplotlib__ library.
- For now, this library support five different charts- `Bar`, `Pie`, `Radar`, `Scatter`, and `Line`.
